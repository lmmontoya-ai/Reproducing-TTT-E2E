# Agent Instructions

**IMPORTANT**
- `og_repo/` is a read-only reference snapshot of the original paper code and artifacts.
- All **reproduction implementation** must live in this repo (outside `og_repo/`).
- Do not modify or add new code inside `og_repo/`.
- When you need to mirror a config or function from the original code, re‑implement it in the main repo and note the source.
